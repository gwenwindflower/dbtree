## Overview

### Common species

The 3 most common species of trees in San Francisco are the <Value data={common_species_counts} column=species_friendly_name row=0 />, the <Value data={common_species_counts} column=species_friendly_name row=1 />, and the <Value data={common_species_counts} column=species_friendly_name row=2 />.

<BarChart
  data={common_species_counts}
  x="species_friendly_name"
  y="count_of_trees"
  title="Most common species"
  subtitle="Species with more than 3000 trees"
  colorPalette={myColors}
/>

```sql common_species_counts
select
    species_friendly_name,
    count_of_trees,

from dbtree.species

where
  count_of_trees > 3000 and
  species_friendly_name != 'Unknown'

order by count_of_trees desc
```

### Trees planted by year

### Species distribution

In between <Value data={planted_at_date_range} column=start fmt='longdate' /> and <Value data={planted_at_date_range} column=end fmt='longdate' />, the most common species of trees planted were the <Value data={top_species_planted_in_date_range} column=species_friendly_name row=0 />, the <Value data={top_species_planted_in_date_range} column=species_friendly_name row=1 />, and the <Value data={top_species_planted_in_date_range} column=species_friendly_name row=2 />.
